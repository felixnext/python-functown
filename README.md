# FuncTown

`FuncTown` is a python library to make working with azure functions easier and remove boilerplate.

## Getting Started

```bash
pip install functown
```

After installing you can easily get your functions error checked (with an auto-response for execptions triggered):

```python
from functown import handle_errors

@handle_errors(debug=True)
def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    logging.info('Python HTTP trigger function processed a request.')

    # ...

    return func.HttpResponse("success", status_code=200)
```

Should an exception happening in the middle, the decorator will auto-parse it (and write to logs if debug is true), then provide a response.

You can also parse JWT tokens and validate them (this currently requires to set the `B2C_ISSUER_URL` and `B2C_APP_ID` environment variables):

```python
from functown.auth import verify_user

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    user, user_id, user_scp, local = verify_user(req, scope=scopes.SCOPE_WRITE)
```

Finally the library also allows you to easily parse arguments coming from the `HttpRequest`:

```python
from functown import RequestArgHandler

def main(req: func.HttpRequest) -> func.HttpResponse:
    args = RequestArgHandler(req)
    data = args.get_body_query("data_name", required=True, allowed=["foo", "bar"])
    switch = args.get_body("bool_name", map_fct='bool')
    file = args.get_file('file_name', required=True)
```

All this should remove boilerplate from Azure-Functions.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the versions available, see the tags on this repository.

## Run Example

The source folder also includes an `example` function that provides a basic azure function,
that leverages the different functionality of the library.

You can create a new Functions app in your Azure Subscripton to test it. Follow these steps:

1. Login to your Azure Portal in the browser
2. Create a new Functions App (note that this should at least be Python 3.8 and a consumption tier is recommended)
    ![Create Fct App](assets/example_create-fct.png)
3. Publish the content of the example folder to the functions app (through VS Code Plug-In or through CLI) - I usually use VSCode directly:
    ![Upload Fct App](assets/example_upload-fct.png)
4. Create a new Application Insights Instance through your Browser in the same resource group as the Functions App
    * Note: Check here - sometimes this instance is already created directly with your Function App
5. Take the `instrumentation key` from the App Insights (found in overview blade) and copy it
6. Go to the Function App in Azure and to the Configuration Blade. There create the config settings specified in `example/config.tmp.json` (use the copied App Insights Instrumentation Key here)
    ![Config](assets/example_config-settings.png)
7. To run the curl commands (you could also test by going on the `TestFuncTown` Example function in your browser) we need a function app key (found under the `App Keys` blade):
    ![App Keys](assets/example_get-key.png)

You can now use `curl` to test various commands against the endpoint:

```bash
# Write a list of curl commands to test the different functionality of the example function

# set the name of your function app (e.g. functownexample) and the key
# note that the function app name might vary and you can find it on the overview blade of your function app
FAPP="functownexample"
FAPP_KEY="YOUR_APP_KEY"

# test the basic functionality
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"print_num": "2", "req": "some req param"}' "https://${FAPP}.azurewebsites.net/api/TestFuncTown?code=${FAPP_KEY}"
# Expected output:
# {
#   "completed": true,
#   "results": {
#     "body_param": "no body param",
#     "query_param": "no query param",
#     "use_exeption": null,
#     "print_num": 2,
#     "print_list": null,
#     "req_param": "some req param"
#   },
#   "logs": [
#     "Using functown v0.1.7",
#     "body_param: no body param",
#     "query_param: no query param",
#     "use_exeption: None",
#     "print_num: 2",
#     "print_num: 0",
#     "print_num: 1",
#     "print_list: None",
#     "req_param: some req param"
#   ]
# }

# you can also test throwing an exception:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"use_exeption": "true"}' "https://${FAPP}.azurewebsites.net/api/TestFuncTown?code=${FAPP_KEY}"
# Expected output:
# {
#   "user_message": "This function executed unsuccessfully",
#   "type": "<class 'TypeError'>",
#   "value": "'str' object cannot be interpreted as an integer",
#   "trace": [
#     "error_decorator.py:79:111 - Vars: ('req', 'ex')",
#     "__init__.py:22:54 - Vars: ('req', 'logger', 'logs', 'args', 'body_param', 'query_param', 'use_exeption', 'print_num', 'i', 'print_list', 'req_param', 'payload')"
#   ]
# }

# some further curl commands to try:
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"print_num": "2", "print_list": ["a", "b", "c"]}' "https://${FAPP}.azurewebsites.net/api/TestFuncTown?code=${FAPP_KEY}"
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"body_param": "some body param", "query_param": "some query param", "req": "required"}' "https://${FAPP}.azurewebsites.net/api/TestFuncTown?code=${FAPP_KEY}"
```

### Testing functown Code

This function also allows to test changes to functown in the development process.
For that simply copy the current `functown` folder into the `example` folder and redeploy the function app.

You should also update the version number in the `__init__.py` file of the `functown` folder before (which needs to be done for any changes, see section on `Versioning`).

You can verify that the new version of the code was picked up by the first log statement in your return.

## Notes

* The `@handle_error` decorator returns additional information to be used in the development process. This can also expose infrormation to attackers, so use responsibly (i.e. make sure to disable for production environments).
